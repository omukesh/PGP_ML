# ML Model for Auto Insurance Industry

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a Machine Learning model to predict whether an owner will initiate an auto insurance claim within the next year. The project workflow includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's characteristics and Machine Learning (ML) modeling for prediction.

## Process Flow

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** 
   - The dataset undergoes initial examination through EDA, where visual and statistical methods are applied to explore patterns and relationships within the data.

2. **Machine Learning Modeling:**
   - After completing EDA, the next step involves training an ML model. The selected algorithm is trained on historical data to predict insurance claims.

## Installation and Setup
To run this notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

This project also utilizes Google Colab to mount and access datasets.

## Usage
1. Mount Google Drive to access datasets.
2. Follow the cells to run EDA, prepare data, and train the model.
3. Model results are evaluated based on predictive accuracy and other relevant metrics.
